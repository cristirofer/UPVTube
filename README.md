# Video Platform Application ‚Äì Software Engineering Project

This project was developed as part of the **Software Engineering** course. It is a desktop video platform application that allows users to register, view and rate videos, upload new content, and manage their profiles and personal information. The main objective was to design and implement a functional software system applying software engineering principles: requirements analysis, modular design, database integration, and user interface development.

## üß∞ Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: C# with Windows Forms (WinForms)
- **Backend**: Oracle Database
- **Data Access**: ADO.NET
- **IDE**: Visual Studio

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **User Registration/Login**
- **Video Browsing and Viewing**
- **Video Rating System**
- **Video Upload Functionality**
- **User Profile and Personal Data Management**
- **Oracle-based Backend for Storing Users, Videos, Ratings, etc.**
